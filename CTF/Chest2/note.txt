Hear ye, hear ye, brave soul of the Lands Between, the tarnished wanderer of the cryptic realms...

"One Cipher to rule them all, forged in the sacred flames of the wisdom of the Erdtree. Heed well this ancient covenant: the Runic Key must be wielded but once, then cast into the Abyss of Forgotten Lore, never to be reclaimed by mortal hands.
Should thy folly lead thee to brandish the same Key twice, mark these words, bearer of the curse - thou shalt summon forth the wrath of the Greater Will. The perfect guardians of secrecy shall rise to smite thy transgression, and thy secrets shall be laid bare before all who seek them.
Three vessels of sound now rest in thy possession - sacred audio scrolls imbued with arcane power. Thou must harness the power of a twin of the artifacts with wisdom and care. Each scroll may be used but once, for their essence is fragile. Should thou attempt to wield either scroll for multiple enchantments, their mystical patterns shall fade and wither, rendering them forever broken and silent.
Remember this warning, oh seeker of hidden knowledge: These twin sounds are thy key and thy burden. Use them for a single sacred joining, then seek new vessels for thy future workings."

*The parchment crumbles to dust as the final words fade into whispers on the wind...
