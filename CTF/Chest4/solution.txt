Solution:

1. Identify Main Function
   We began by examining the 'main' function which initializes a series of variables and performs checks on command-line arguments.


2. Encoded Data Storage
   Several MOV instructions store long hexadecimal constants into stack variables. These constants, when interpreted as ASCII strings in little-endian order, form the encoded flag.

3. Encoding Breakdown
   The program loads the following 32 bytes of encoded data (but only uses the first 25 bytes):
      
   This corresponds to the encoded flag in memory.

4. Key Setup
   Another sequence of MOV instructions stores 32 bytes of key data:
      

5. Password Length Check
   The input password is validated to be exactly 25 characters long
   
6. XOR Operation
   The program uses XOR to compare each character in the input against the encoded flag:
  
   user_input[i] ^ key[i] == encoded[i]
   =>
   user_input[i] = encoded[i] ^ key[i]
   

7. Recovering the Password
   Using a simple Python script, we XOR the first 25 bytes of the encoded flag with the key to recover the original password.

8. Final Output
   The decoded password (flag) is:
   
   FLAG{X0r_1s_0ld_but_g0ld}
